# ParkinCare
Sketching A healthier Future with Parkinsion

### Problem Statement

Millions of people globally have Parkinson's disease, a serious brain disorder. Detecting it early is vital for good treatment. But the tests we use now, like DaTscan and MRI, are expensive and can be risky. Many folks wait until their symptoms get really bad before going to the doctor, which makes treatment less effective. We need a tool that's easy to use and doesn't cost a lot to catch Parkinson's early and help people get the right care sooner.


### 🛠️ Key Functionalities

•	The project's primary aim is to employ machine learning and a mobile app for the early detection of Parkinson's disease.
•	Our future app will simplify the process of identifying signs of Parkinson's disease.
•	Users will have the ability to draw pictures or upload photos for analysis.
•	The app will analyze these drawings and images for potential disease indicators.
•	This has the potential to enhance the treatment prospects for individuals with Parkinson's disease
