### Problem Statement

Millions of people globally have Parkinson's disease, a serious brain disorder. Detecting it early is vital for good treatment. But the tests we use now, like DaTscan and MRI, are expensive and can be risky. Many folks wait until their symptoms get really bad before going to the doctor, which makes treatment less effective. We need a tool that's easy to use and doesn't cost a lot to catch Parkinson's early and help people get the right care sooner.
