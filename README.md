##ParkinCaew: Your Go-To Dementia Aid Solution

HeadHome aims to reduce the dangers posed by dementia wandering and provide caregivers of our dementia counterparts with an effective means of locating them and safely returning them home.

### Problem Statement

"6 in 10 people with dementia will experience wandering episodes."
- Alzheimer's Association

With the onset of an aging population, the prevalence of dementia has risen drastically over the years. People with dementia often experience confusion, disorientation, and memory loss, which can cause them to wander away from their homes or care facilities without realizing where they are going. Dementia wandering episodes are not only physically dangerous for patients but also emotionally traumatic for their caregivers.

### üõ†Ô∏è Key Functionalities

1. **Dementia Patient**
   - The Dementia Patient can request help from their Caregiver and begin navigation back home by tapping the red "Navigate Home" button on their home page.
   - The application will also begin navigation when the Patient leaves the configurable safe zone radius around their home or when they press the red button on the companion wrist wearable device.
   - This will display a route home on the Google Maps widget, updated as the patient progresses, rerouting when necessary.

2. **Caregiver**
   - The Caregiver receives a notification when their respective Patients start to navigate home, informing them about the Patient's current location.
   - Caregivers can choose to send an SOS alert signal to Volunteers if needed.
   - Caregivers can contact the Volunteers who are guiding the Patient back home through the application.

3. **Volunteers**
   - Volunteers can view nearby SOS alerts and select the Patient they wish to help.
   - The app provides Volunteers with the current location of the Patient and allows them to redirect to Google Maps for navigation.
   - Volunteers can start leading the Patient home after verifying the Patient's Authentication ID.
