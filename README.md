# ParkinCare
Sketching A healthier Future with Parkinsion

### Problem Statement

Millions of people globally have Parkinson's disease, a serious brain disorder. Detecting it early is vital for good treatment. But the tests we use now, like DaTscan and MRI, are expensive and can be risky. Many folks wait until their symptoms get really bad before going to the doctor, which makes treatment less effective. We need a tool that's easy to use and doesn't cost a lot to catch Parkinson's early and help people get the right care sooner.


### üõ†Ô∏è Key Functionalities

1. **Dementia Patient**
   - The Dementia Patient can request help from their Caregiver and begin navigation back home by tapping the red "Navigate Home" button on their home page.
   - The application will also begin navigation when the Patient leaves the configurable safe zone radius around their home or when they press the red button on the companion wrist wearable device.
   - This will display a route home on the Google Maps widget, updated as the patient progresses, rerouting when necessary.

2. **Caregiver**
   - The Caregiver receives a notification when their respective Patients start to navigate home, informing them about the Patient's current location.
   - Caregivers can choose to send an SOS alert signal to Volunteers if needed.
   - Caregivers can contact the Volunteers who are guiding the Patient back home through the application.

3. **Volunteers**
   - Volunteers can view nearby SOS alerts and select the Patient they wish to help.
   - The app provides Volunteers with the current location of the Patient and allows them to redirect to Google Maps for navigation.
   - Volunteers can start leading the Patient home after verifying the Patient's Authentication ID.

### üéØ UN's Sustainable Development Goals & Targets
